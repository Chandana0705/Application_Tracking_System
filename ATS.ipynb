            "3.  **Clean Formatting:** The use of bullet points, clear headings, and a standard font makes it easy for an ATS to read and extract information. No complex graphics or images.\n",
            "4.  **Quantifiable Metrics:** \"CGPA: 9.51,\" \"Secured 78% in NPTEL,\" \"Led VALIANT 2023\" are good examples of quantifying achievements.\n",
            "5.  **Relevant Links:** LinkedIn and GitHub are excellent for tech roles and signal proactivity to an ATS and hiring manager.\n",
            "6.  **Specific Technologies:** Listing \"Google Gemini API,\" \"HTML, CSS, JavaScript,\" \"SQL, Firebase,\" \"VS Code\" shows specific tool proficiency.\n",

An ATS will likely flag this as an error, an illogical entry, or even potential fabrication, which could lead to immediate disqualification.\n",
            "    *   **Solution:** **Correct this date immediately.** If it's a planned internship for 2025, you should either indicate that (\"Expected Summer 2025\") or remove it until it's completed, depending on the role you're applying for. If it was in the past, correct it to the actual year.\n",

            "**2. Quantify Achievements & Impact (Even for Internships/Projects):**\n",

            "    *   **Examples to Improve:**\n",
            "        *   **AIML Intern:** \"Worked on applying core concepts...\" -> *What specific problems? What was the outcome?* \"Built and evaluated basic ML models for classification and prediction tasks using Python.\" -> *What was the accuracy/performance? What data sets? For what purpose?*\n",
            "        *   **AI Intern:** \"Gained hands-on experience...\" -> *How did this experience lead to a tangible outcome? What specific models/tasks did you complete?*\n",

            "    *   **Solution:** For each bullet point, try to answer: \"So what?\" or \"How much?\" or \"What was the result?\" Use action verbs + what you did + quantifiable result/impact.\n",

            "**3. Stronger Action Verbs:**\n",

            "    *   **Solution:** Briefly mention the *type* of problem you addressed. For example, \"Applied AI/ML concepts to optimize [specific process] leading to [measurable improvement].\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Consider a \"Portfolio\" or \"Personal Website\" Link (Optional but good):**\n",
